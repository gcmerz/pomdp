    "    a. Death, In situ post-cancer treatment, and invasive post-cancer treatment are fully observable and absorbing states. This means that we know with probability one whether you are in one of these states and once you have entered one of these states, the model ends. We can assume we know with probability one whether you enter in situ post-cancer treatment or invasive post-cancer treatment because of the incredibly accuracy of medical biopsys, and in our model, if you recieve a positive mammogram, you immediately get a biopsy. \n",
    "\n",
    "    b. At each state, you can take one of two actions: you can decide to get a mammogram, or you can decide to wait. If you decide to get a mammogram, you will either \"observe\" a positive or negative result, and if you decide to wait, you will either \"observe\" cancer on your own (self-detect) or not. Time is incremented in periods of six months, which is consistent with both how often patients get check-ups and the current guidelines for when to get a mammogram\n",

    "b. These nubmers are also included in the file stats.py and can also be explained intuitively. If you are healthy, your probability of transitioning to any of the cancer states or death is based off of the population probabilities. If you have any form of cancer, you cannot transition back to healthy, and if you have invasive cancer, you cannot transition back to in-situ cancer. However, you can transition from in-situ to invasive cancer. Once your state is invasive cancer, your probability of death also increases. Because in-situ cancer rarely if ever causes death, we have made the transition probability to death the same as for when you are healthy. \n",

These probabilities are based off of the known *sensitivity* and *specificty* of mammograms and self detection. Sensitivity is the likelihood that you observe a positive mammogram given that you have some form of cancer, and specificity is the likelihood that you observe a negative mammogram given that you don't have some form of cancer. \n",

Because time steps are in incrememnts of six months, and we initialize our model for women of age 40 in order to be consistent with current mammography guidelines, we default from initial time 0 to final time 120, which is consistent with our patient living 40 years.
